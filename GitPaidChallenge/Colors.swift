// Having the colors like this in a config file is a great idea!
// I'd suggest expanding this to a class with static member including 
// all this sort of config info.
// I'd suggest expanding this to include fonts, images, and other things
// that are reused through the app.
// Putting this info in a class also puts it in a nice namespace which makes
// it clear thorughout the code where the info comes from.
// ie, Config.appGreen, Config.gridIcon
